# CS-250

In working within an agile environment, interpreting user needs is key. Knowing exactly what the user wants, and even sometimes being able to predict the questions
and concerns that can arise, is a valuable tool toward creating a better product. In this way, creating user stories can help with this. By speaking directly with
the user and gaining insight into the user's needs, interests, and desires, a Product Owner in an agile environment can note exactly what the client needs at any
given time. Additionally, the user stories can be updated as the client meets with the Product Owner on a regular basis, lessening or even eliminating the need to
"start from scratch" as could happen using other methodologies.

In my future development work, I intend to use some of the skills I have worked on during this course. Using an agile-based approach, I can plan my project in
shorter bursts, similar to sprints. I will begin by creating my own "user stories" and defining exactly what is expected for each facet of a product. Then, I can
test my code as a tester would during a sprint. Finally, if changes are needed, I can easily implement those changes because I will update them in a Product Backlog
fashion.

In software development, being a good team member means that one is communicative above all else. Because communication is key, one must be willing to meet with the
other members of the team on a regular basis and be ready to discuss not only successes, but also impediments or anything that is causing confusion. These meetings
must happen with everyone keeping an open mind and expecting honesty and contribution. Additionally, being a good team member means that one has to be versatile.
A tester should be able to assume a developer role and vice versa if needed, although specialities are recognized and used if possible. Finally, in Scrum, there is
no hierarchy. All members of every team should be seen as equals. In this way, team members don't feel the need to loom over another, but able to contribute to a
product equally.
